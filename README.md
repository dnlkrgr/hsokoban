# hsokoban

Another sokoban clone

## Building with nix

This is only conveniently possible on nixos as the graphics card driver, kernel and xserver need to match.

## Levels

Level sets can be downloaded from [here](http://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels). Download a `.txt` file
and rename it to `levels.txt` in the current directory from which you start hsokoban.

# Assets:

The beautiful tile set was made by Daniel Cook:
